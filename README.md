Hi, I'm Lailei. 

I think information retrieval algorithms are pretty cool, so I've been on an Elasticsearch kick since January. 
I'm currently learning about NLP models like GPT-2 and GPT-3. I'm happiest writing APIs and working on servers and databases, but I've got a background in product design, so I can do front end if I _have to_. 

My favorite data structures are dictionaries/maps and matrices, my favorite algorithm is dijkstra's, and my favorite topic in machine learning is the very unsexy decision tree. I've never met a programming language I don't like. I prefer clarity over cleverness. 

I bake pastries sometimes, tell weird jokes, and go for very slow, very amateur runs.
