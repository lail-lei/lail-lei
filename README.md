Hi, I'm Lailei. I'm a software engineer III at IKEA. This is my personal github account.

I think information retrieval algorithms are pretty cool, so I've been on an Elasticsearch kick since January 2021. I love tinkering with NLP transformer models like GPT-2 and GPT-3 and drawing pictures with CSS. 

I've never met a programming language I don't like. I bake pastries sometimes.
