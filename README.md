Hi, I'm Lailei. 

I think information retrieval algorithms are pretty cool, so I've been on an Elasticsearch kick since January. 
I'm currently learning about NLP models like GPT-2 and GPT-3. 

I've got a background in product design, so I can do front end if I _have to_. I'm much happier working on server and database architecture.

My favorite data structure is the _graph_ and my favorite algorithm is dijkstra's. 

I bake pastries sometimes.
